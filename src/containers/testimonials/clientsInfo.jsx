      "As Tewodros Yirga's project advisor and instructor, I have had the pleasure of witnessing his remarkable technical skills, dedication, and innovative mindset firsthand. Tewodros is an exceptionally talented computer scientist with a deep understanding of IoT and software development. His final year project—designing and implementing a functional drone for material delivery—was a testament to his ability to merge theory with practical applications. He demonstrated expertise in hardware-software integration, networking, and real-time communication, all while maintaining a strong work ethic and collaborative spirit. His polite and cool-headed demeanor makes him a pleasure to work with, and I have no doubt that he will excel in any professional setting. I highly recommend Tewodros for any role in technology and innovation.",
